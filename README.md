# PrismWebsite

Welcome aboard this project! There's lots to do, I have written some features that need to be added down below the Bible verse.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE PRISM PROJECT?

    Prism is an invention that spawned from a prayer for the sole purpose of fueling a mission of spreading God's Love, Hope, and Gospel to everyone - with active focus on the homeless, the widows, and the orphans. Also, I've developed a growing urge to help our veterans aswell, esspecially the homeless ones. ALL "expendable proceeds" from Prism will go towards this mission; By expendable I mean apart from the upkeep costs.
    
    Only The Lord will make this possible. He started the work in me, and only through His Will will it reach completion.
    (verse 6 below)

                                                        "

       Philippians 1:1-10 English Standard Version (ESV)
    Greeting
    1 Paul and Timothy, servants[a] of Christ Jesus,

    To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers[b] and deacons:[c]

    2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

    Thanksgiving and Prayer
    3 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, 5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. 
    
        6 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. 7 It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace,[d] both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. 
    
    8 For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. 9 And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, 10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ.
